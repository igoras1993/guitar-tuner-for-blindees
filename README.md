 - Type "e", "h", "G", "D", "A" or "E" into appearing console window and press Enter
 - Play note at your instrument, near microphone and listen for sound:
 - if sound note is "high", that means that your instrument is playing too high note.
 - if sound note is "low", that means that your instrument is playing too low note.
 - if sound note is at middle level of "high" and "low", that means that your instrument is tuned perfectly.
 - Observe following: the further you are from perfect tuning, the more rapidly is sound beating.
 - You can also directly apply values for frequency by typing for example: "329HZ"
 - To end the program, you are typing "S"
 - To pause program from playing sound, type "p"
